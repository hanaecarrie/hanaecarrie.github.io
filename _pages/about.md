Hello!

I am 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My research is jointly funded by the Integrative Science \& Engineering Program (ISEP) and by the NUS Institute of Data Science (IDS). My work is supervised by Prof WONG Lim Soon from the NUS School of Computing and by Dr. SKANDERUP Anders from the ASTAR research institute.

My PhD work tackles the computational analysis of cell-free DNA data acquired with Next-Generation Sequencing technology in liquid biopsy. I focus on two main applications:
- oncology
- prenatal testing

I come from France where I studied Engineering at CentraleSupélec, part of the Paris-Saclay University. I specialised in Biomedical Sciences during my Master and in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science during my Bachelor. To enter CentraleSupélec, I spent two years in 'preparatory class' (Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles) at Les Lazaristes in Lyon. This stands for an elite and intensive 2-year university level preparation in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry for the highly competitive national entrance to the leading French ‘Grandes Écoles’ for scientific studies.

During my Engineering studies, I took a year to complete two 6-month internships in medical imaging. I first interned at NeuroSpin in the Paris area, France where I worked on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image reconstruction with Philippe Ciuciu, Ph.D.. I then went to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital in Boston, MA, USA to work on neuroscience imaging with Mark Andermann, Ph.D.. Finally, I completed my Master thesis at General Electric Healthcare in the Paris area, France in the oncology software team in Deep Learning with Ronan Quélever.
