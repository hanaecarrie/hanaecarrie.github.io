I am 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My research is jointly funded by the [Integrative Science & Engineering Program (ISEP)](https://isep.nus.edu.sg) and by the [NUS Institute of Data Science (IDS)](https://ids.nus.edu.sg). My work is supervised by [Prof WONG Lim Soon](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/wongls/) from the NUS School of Computing (SoC) and by [Dr. SKANDERUP Anders](https://www.skandlab.org/) from the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) part of the ASTAR research agency.

My PhD work tackles the **Computational Analysis of the Next-Generation Sequencing of cell-free DNA data in Liquid Biopsy**. I focus on two main applications:
- oncology
- prenatal testing

I come from France where I studied Engineering at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), part of the [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). I specialised in Biomedical Sciences during my Master and in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science during my Bachelor. To enter CentraleSupélec, I did an intensive 2-year university level preparation in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in preparatory classes at Les Lazaristes in Lyon for the highly competitive national entrance to the leading French ‘Grandes Écoles’ for scientific studies.

During my Engineering studies, I took a year to complete two 6-month internships in medical imaging. I first interned at NeuroSpin in the Paris area, France where I worked on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image reconstruction with Philippe Ciuciu, Ph.D.. I then went to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital in Boston, MA, USA to work on neuroscience imaging with Mark Andermann, Ph.D.. Finally, I completed my Master thesis at General Electric Healthcare in the Paris area, France in the oncology software team in Deep Learning with Ronan Quélever.
