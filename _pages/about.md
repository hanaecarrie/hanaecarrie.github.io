I am **final year Ph.D. candidate** at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I work on **Bioinformatics** under the supervision of [Anders Skanderup, Ph.D.](https://www.skandlab.org/) from the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) part of the ASTAR research agency and of [Prof Lim Soon Wong, Ph.D.](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/wongls/) from the NUS School of Computing (SoC). My research is jointly funded by the [NUS Institute of Data Science (IDS)](https://ids.nus.edu.sg) and by the [Integrative Science & Engineering Program (ISEP)](https://isep.nus.edu.sg). 

My research interest is in Computational Cancer Genomics, after a significant experience in Medical Imaging. My thesis is entitled:
**Computational Analysis of the Next-Generation Sequencing of cell-free DNA data in Liquid Biopsy**.
I am focusing on two main applications:
- oncology: Comprehensive Benchmarking of Cancer Somatic Mutation Callers in cell-free DNA, Fragmentomics for Circulating Tumor DNA Quantification
- noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT): Reference-free Trisomy Detection & Fetal Fraction Estimation

I hold an Engineering Degree from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), part of the [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in France. I specialised in Biomedical Data Science during my Master and in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science during my Bachelor.

During my studies, I completed a total of three 5- to 6-month internships in **Medical Imaging**.
I first interned at NeuroSpin in Paris area, France where I worked in Inria and CEA on Dictionary Learning for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image reconstruction with [Philippe Ciuciu, Ph.D.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=X-w36z8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works). I then went to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a **Harvard Medical School** teaching hospital in Boston, MA, USA to work on neuroscience imaging with [Mark Andermann, Ph.D.](https://www.andermannlab.com/research). Finally, I completed my Master thesis at **General Electric Healthcare** in Paris area, France, in the oncology team with senior software engineer Ronan Quélever. 

One experience in particular led me to become passionate about oncology. Indeed, back in 2015, I became a volunteer in the [Cheer Up](https://cheer-up.fr/) charity organisation to visit teenagers fighting cancer at Gustave Roussy hospital and to help them some fufilling personal projects that helped them to project themselves into a better future. I was so involved that I became president of the organisation for a year.

I am now thinking about my next step! I am looking for a **permanent research scientist position in the industry from January 2024**. I am highly interested in clinical R&D innovation, particularly in genetic and eventually in imaging analysis **for oncology**. I am open to a various range of cancer applications such as biomarker discovery, drug development, disease modelling, clinical trials design/monitoring/evaluation.
